## Deploying Full Stack Web App on AWS using Terraform
This repository demonstrates the process of deploying a full stack web application on AWS using Terraform. By leveraging the power of Terraform's infrastructure as code (IaC) capabilities, you can easily provision and manage the required cloud resources for your application.

## Overview
Deploying a full stack web application on the cloud involves setting up a variety of resources, including virtual machines, databases, load balancers, and networking components. This repository provides a structured approach to automating the deployment process using Terraform, ensuring scalability, repeatability, and maintainability.

## Features
## Terraform:
Terraform enables you to define and manage cloud infrastructure using declarative code. This ensures that your infrastructure is consistent across different environments and can be versioned alongside your application code.

##Amazon Web Services (AWS):
AWS provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services that can be leveraged to host and deploy your full stack web application. This repository focuses on provisioning resources on AWS.
